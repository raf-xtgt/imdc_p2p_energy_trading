- after 30 mins of the DA is done, the transactions are stored in the database.
- one validator mines and creates a block and that block is then stored in a temporary blockchain
- the other validators who are not the current logged in one are notified.
- they use the transactions and use the nonce to generate a similar hash if matches the block is made permanent



to do now:
- generate more blocks
- find a specific folder to hold the blockchain
- make a local copy of:
    - AccountBalance
    - blockchain
    - latest index
